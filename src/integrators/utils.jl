Dealing with discontinuities

If we hit a discontinuity (this is checked in `apply_step!`), then we remove the
discontinuity, additional discontinuities at the current time point (if present), and
maybe also discontinuities and time stops coming shortly after the current time point
in `handle_discontinuities!`. The order of the discontinuity at the current time point is
defined as the lowest order of all these discontinuities.

If the problem is not neutral, we will only add additional discontinuities if
this order is less or equal to the order of the algorithm in
`add_next_discontinuities!`. If we add discontinuities, we add discontinuities
of the next order caused by constant lags (these we can calculate explicitly and
just add them to `d_discontinuities` and `tstops`) and we add the current
discontinuity to `tracked_discontinuities` which is the array of old
discontinuities that are checked by a `DiscontinuityCallback` (if existent).
